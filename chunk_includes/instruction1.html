<p>
In each trial, you will see a pair of sentences (A and B) presented on the screen. These sentences have the same words but are  different in the word order.
For example, <br>
which cowboy the bull had gored.　<br>
which bull the cowboy had gored.　<br>
<br>

Your task is to make judgments about which sentence is more natural and likely.
Please chose one of the four options: "Both are natural", "A is more natural", "B is more natural", and "Neither is natural".
Chose "A is more natural" or "B is more natural" when you are confident. If you are not sure if either A or B is more natural than the other, chose "Both are natural" or "Neither is natural".
