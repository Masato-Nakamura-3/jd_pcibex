<h3>Instruction 1</h3>

<p>
In each trial, you will see a sentence presented on the screen word by word. But the sentence is cut in the middle, so please predict what word would follow the last word presented.
The last word of the partial sentence is in <font color="red">red</font> ink while others are in black. Once you see the red word, please produce a word that is likely to follow it <strong>as quickly as you can</strong>.
</p>
  
<p>
Please try to produce a word that fits well to the specific context and avoid answering the same word again and again for different sentences.
