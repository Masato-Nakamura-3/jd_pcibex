<h3>Instruction</h3>

<p>
In each trial, you will see a pair of sentences (A and B) presented on the screen. These sentences have the same words but are  different in the word order.
For example, <br><br>

A: The aquarium visitor wondered which trainer the penguins had followed.<br>
B: The aquarium visitor wondered which penguins the trainer had followed. <br> <br>

Your task is to make judgments about which sentence is more natural and describing likely events.
Please chose one from the four options: "Both are natural", "A is more natural", "B is more natural", and "Neither is natural".
Chose "A is more natural" or "B is more natural" only when you are confident. If you are not sure if either A or B is more natural than the other, chose "Both are natural" or "Neither is natural".
