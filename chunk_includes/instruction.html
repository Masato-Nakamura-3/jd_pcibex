<h3>Instruction</h3>

<p>
In each trial, you will see a pair of sentences (A and B) presented on the screen. These sentences have the same words but are  different in the word order.
For example, <br><br>

A: The aquarium visitor wondered which trainer the penguins had followed.<br>
B: The aquarium visitor wondered which penguins the trainer had followed. <br> <br>

Your task is to make judgments about which sentence is more natural and describing likely events.
Please chose one from the four options: <br><br>
"Both are natural"<br>
"A is more natural"<br>
"B is more natural"<br>
"Neither is natural".<br><br>
Chose "A is more natural" or "B is more natural" only when you are confident. If you are not sure if either A or B is more natural than the other, chose "Both are natural" or "Neither is natural".<br><br>
