<h3>Instruction 2</h3>


<p>
When giving a continuation, please answer <strong>as clearly as possible in a loud voice</strong> so that your answer can be identified easily. Imagine you are talking to somebody 15 feet away form you!
</p>

<p>
Please make sure that no sound other than your answer is recorded. This is not just about background noise, but also filler words such as "umm" or "well...".
</p>

<p>
Please make sure to produce a word that comes to your mind first. Don't stop in the middle of your speech to change what you say.
